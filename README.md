# Image_Steganography

Steganography is the process of hiding a secret message within a larger one in such a way that someone can not know the presence or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that a message is communicated.

_Hey, This is Sai Tharun here and the person who wrote this cool bit of code. This text is the secret message that is to be hidden in the picture._
